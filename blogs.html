            The purpose for the Blogs page is to provide writing samples of work I have completed. Some of the blogs were completed during my time as an intern for Destination Mansfield and others were blogs I completed in various areas of work/school.

            Artists of Mansfield
       </h3>
       <p>
            This was a topic I decided to write about after I saw several murals in downtown Mansfield, Ohio. Two local artists had completed various pieces of artwork on their own, in all medias, and had also been commissioned to work together on a street mural for the city. I had the opportunity to interview Robin and Allison and learn about their artwork.

         Personal challenges are a crucial part of life; they help us better understand joy. Making progress usually means experiencing growing pains. It is important to remember not to get discouraged as we progress through the difficulties of life. <br><br>
