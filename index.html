           This personal portfolio was created using my basic HTML and CSS skills in order to showcase my work experiences and the skills I've developed as an English major and Spanish minor. I love learning about people and their individual stories. From the time I was young, I discovered my love of the English language, especially writing for othersâ€™ understanding. Through my schooling and experience, I have learned how to write a wide array of material in various techniques using many style guides. School has also taught me the basics of the Adobe Creative Cloud applications and the basics of creating a website. My goal is to help enhace others' writings as I further develop my own skills. Go to my <a href="about.html"> About Me</a> page to learn more about my background.
