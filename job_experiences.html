                BYU-PathwayConnect Curriculum Analyst
            </h3>
            <p class="center">
                Starting in the Winter 2020 Semester and currently, I am an intern for the BYU-PathwayConnect Curriculum Analysis Department. BYU-PathwayConnect helped strengthen my ability to test products (online courses) and review the areas of needed improvement. I reviewed and wrote analyses for courses that students in approximately 150 countries needed to understand. By so doing, I had the privilege of exploring the logic of how things were run while working with others to broaden perspective for better product delivery. I loved editing, revising, and creating course material that is now used and will be used for the program. I have also helped train various employees in the department practices.

                Brigham Young University-Idaho Online Course Review and Copyediting 
            </h3>
            <p class="center">
                In April of 2019 through December of 2019, I was hired to be an editor and course reviewer for the online courses at Brigham Young University-Idaho. This job entailed working with a team of editors in order to assure the online courses could be easily understood for both native and non-native English speakers. I have copyedited a large variety of courses, from religion to science and even Spanish. As I check for grammatical issues, I am also checking copyrights and assuring that students are able to understand and complete all the assigned work. One of the professors at the university just finished writing a textbook for a computer science course. I am currently in the process of copyediting the author’s 264-page textbook.

                Destination Mansfield—Richland County
            </h3>
            <p class="center">
                Over the Summer of 2019, I completed an internship with Destination Mansfield — Richland County (a local tourism bureau). I had the opportunity to complete a wide array of works including copyediting, writing articles for the bureau’s blog, writing e-newsletters for 34,000 subscribed visitors, and writing press releases. I also had the chance to update membership information on the bureau’s website.

                Yearbook Editor
            </h3>
            <p class="center">
                September 2013 through June 2016 I participated in my school's 301-page yearbook creation, and September 2015 through June 2016 I was the head editor. There is more that goes into a yearbook besides the typical though capturing pictures and writing a small caption for the photos that turned out the best. As the yearbook editor for three years (and lead editor for one year), I had the chance to work through the entire yearbook process: publications, photography and photoshop, interviewing, creating layouts for each page, and writing captions and the section articles.
