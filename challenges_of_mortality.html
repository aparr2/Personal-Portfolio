           Challenges of Mortality
       </h2>
       <p class="text">
            Personal challenges are a crucial part of life; they help us better understand joy. Making progress usually means experiencing growing pains. It is important to remember not to get discouraged as we progress through the difficulties of life.
       </p>
       <p class="text">
            Elder Robert D. Hales taught, “when the challenges of mortality come, and they come for all of us, it may seem hard to have faith and hard to believe. At these times only faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement can bring us peace, hope, and understanding. Only faith that He suffered for our sakes will give us the strength to endure to the end” (October 2004, General Conference). By having faith in Jesus Christ that endured the pains of the world, we will develop the faith to endure our personal challenges.

            Preparation doesn’t ensure ease
        </h3>
        <p class="text">
            We are frequently taught that life will bring challenges. We know and expect them to come, yet, the moment they arrive, we often can’t comprehend why they are so difficult. As the Savior walked with Peter, James, and John, preparing to enter Gethsemane, He “began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; and saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: terry ye here, and watch” (See Mark 14:33-34). Even He was amazed at the pain He was about to endure.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The Savior was prepared to pay the price of sin for the entirety of the world, but He also knew it was not going to be an easy task. Jesus Christ knew He was to experience great pains, so He asked His friends to tarry with Him. He chose to experience our sorrow so He could also experience our joy. Christ is the ultimate example of endurance, but He has also blessed us with ecclesiastical leaders and friends to look unto as examples.

            “I don’t think I can do this”
        </h3>
        <p class="text"> 
            As we look to others, it is important to remember that we are only seeing a small portion of their lives. They too are experiencing challenges and growing pains. We experience life to learn and help others along their way, but others are doing the same for us. Their stories can help give us strength.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            In a Brigham Young University-Idaho devotional, Sister Susan Bednar, wife of Elder David A. Bednar, explained how she overcame some of her difficulties. There were many times when she told the Lord and her husband, “I don’t think I can do this.” But, as she continued pressing forward, she developed the faith to act. She counseled with the students to “have the faith to act, even if you don’t know beforehand the thing that you should do.”

            Nevertheless, Not What I Will
        </h3>
        <p class="text">
            In Gethsemane, Christ prayed unto the Father saying, “all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt” (See Mark 14:36). Christ had to face hard things and remind Himself that through the Father, all things can be accomplished. He recognized Heavenly Father’s divine help in all things.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            It is okay to be afraid. It is okay to think things are difficult. However, when things get difficult, we too must say unto the Father, “nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.”
